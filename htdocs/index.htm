			<h2>Salutations</h2>

				<p>In May 2012 I graduated with my master's in technical communication and information design from Illinois Institute of Technology. Before going back to school, I worked in training. I am currently a project management professional intern at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Online. I also work as a freelance writer, editor, and document designer. </p>

				<p>My schedule is limited, but if you have a project that could use my help in any of the following areas, feel free to contact me.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Copy editing</li>

						<li>Document design</li>
						<li>Technical writing</li>
						<li>Instructional design</li>
