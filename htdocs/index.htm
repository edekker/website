			<h2>Salutations</h2>

				<p>I am a full-time student pursuing my master's in technical communication and information design at Illinois Institute of Technology. I have an undergraduate degree in marketing and a training background. While in school, I'm working as a research assistant and freelance writer, editor, and designer, and I have a small consignment business on eBay.</p>

				<p>That's a little bit about me. Feel free to take a look at my resume and portfolio to learn more, and let me know if you have a project that could use my help.</p>
