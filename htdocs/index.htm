			<h2>Salutations</h2>

				<p>I am a full-time student pursuing my master's in technical communication and information design at Illinois Institute of Technology. Before going back to school, I worked in training. Now I work primarily as a freelance writer, editor, and document designer. On the side, I work as a research assistant, write website metadata for IIT, and sell clutter on eBay.</p>

				<p>My schedule is limited, but if you have a project that could use my help in any of the following areas, feel free to contact me.

					<ul>
						<li>Copy editing</li>
						<li>Proofreading</li>
						<li>Document design</li>
						<li>Technical writing</li>
						<li>Instructional design</li>
						<li>Project management</li>
						<li>Content development</li>
					</ul>
