			<h2>Curricula</h2>

				<p>At the Willow Creek Association, I managed the content of the participant's guides for three financial-management curricula co-published with NavPress. The first was a revision of the original <cite>Good $ense Budget Course</cite> called <a href="http://www.willowcreek.com/wca_prod.asp?invtid=PR31921"><cite>Freed-Up Financial Living</cite></a>. I made substantial revisions to the original participant's guide to match the content of the new video-based teaching, and I worked with a graphic designer to improve the visual flow of the content and exercises. I also did fact-checking to ensure the math was right and all sources were properly cited.</p>

				<p>To follow up on the six-session <cite>Freed-Up Financial Living</cite> course, my team produced two shorter, two-session courses called <a href="http://www.willowcreek.com/wca_prod.asp?invtid=PR34215"><cite>Freed-Up from Debt</cite></a> and <a href="http://www.willowcreek.com/wca_prod.asp?invtid=PR34168"><cite>Freed-Up in Later Life</cite></a>. I wrote the participant guide content based on the video teaching script, and made edits throughout the video shoot so that the wording of the participant's guide and the videos would be consistent.</p>
