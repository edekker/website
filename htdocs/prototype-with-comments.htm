<!--

All XHTML documents begin with a DOCTYPE; this one is for XHTML 1.0 Strict.
Normally, the DOCTYPE is the very first line of XHTML files:

-->
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

<!--
+ + + + + BEGIN html + + + +

<!--

Change id="example-com" to your actual domain, replacing dots with hyphens
(e.g., example.org would be id="example-org"):

-->
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en" id="example-com">

	than a local Web server at http://localhost/, you will need to change

	FAVICONS
	
	The paths for each icon should be the same; use your full URL. Most
	Web browsers will use the rel="icon" link, but Internet Explorer 
	prefers the rel="shortcut icon" link. 
	
	In both cases, the type="" attribute-value should
	reflect your icon type (e.g., "image/gif" for .gif files; "image/ico" for
	.ico files).
