			<h2>About Erica</h2>

				<p>I earned my bachelor's in marketing at Valparaiso University in 2005. After graduation, I took an administrative role on the training team at the <a href="http://willowcreek.com">Willow Creek Association</a> (WCA), a non-profit organization that conducts conferences and publishes training resources for church leaders. My team was responsible for planning conference content and creating curriculum.</p>

				<p>Within a year, I became responsible for producing all content-related print materials for the conferences. For major events, I worked with a designer and print manager to determine the written and visual content that would appear on each page of the event notebook. For smaller events and breakout sessions, I worked directly with the speakers to edit, write (when needed), and design their session handouts. From 2006 to 2007, I created a total of nearly 450 handouts.</p>

				<p>In 2008, my team's responsibilities shifted to focus on online training. We created a series of short-form <a href="/trainingvideos.htm">training videos</a> and downloadable PDF training tools. That year I also took on the creation of the 150-page downloadable <a href="/discussionguides.htm">discussion guide</a> that accompanies the annual Global Leadership Summit Team Edition DVD.</p>

				<p>I also worked on several traditionally published and web-based courses. In 2008-2009, I managed the content of the participant's guides for three financial-management <a href="/curricula.htm">curricula</a>. In 2009-2010, I produced more than 15 webinars using the <a href="http://gotowebinar.com">GoToWebinar</a> platform and developed the content for two eight-week <a href="/elearningcourses.htm">e-learning courses</a>, including two live webcasts per course</p>

				<p>Through working on these projects, I began to realize how important visual and textual clarity are to me, and I decided to seek further education to increase my communication and design skills. So, in August 2010, I left the WCA to begin full-time pursuit of my <a href="http://www.iit.edu/csl/hum/programs/grad/tcid.shtml">master's in technical communication and information design</a> at <a href="http://iit.edu/">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>. Through my <a href="/iitcoursework.htm">studies</a>, I hope to continue learning how best to organize information on a page and bring visual clarity to a message, so that at a glance a reader has a grasp of what the content entails. I am also interested in learning the communication principles involved in creating informative documents that people actually want to read. </p>
