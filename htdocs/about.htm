			<h2>About Erica</h2>

				<p>I earned my bachelor's in marketing at Valparaiso University in 2005. After graduation, I took an administrative role on the training team at the <a href="http://willowcreek.com">Willow Creek Association</a> (WCA), a non-profit organization that conducts conferences and publishes training resources for church leaders. My team was responsible for planning conference content and creating curriculum.</p>
				<p>Within a year, I became responsible for producing all content-related print materials for the conferences. For major events, I worked with a designer and print manager to determine the written and visual content that would appear on each page of the event notebook. For smaller events and breakout sessions, I worked directly with the speakers to write (when needed), edit, and design their session handouts. In total, I created nearly 450 handouts, and I also managed the content of the participant's guides for three financial-management <a href="curricula.htm">curricula</a>.</p>
				<p>When my team's responsibilities shifted to focus on online training, I project-managed the creation of more than 150 downloadable training resources and designed a template to distill content from past conference sessions into standalone tools with key concepts, suggested next steps, and discussion questions. I also project-managed the creation of 58 short-form <a href="trainingvideos.htm">training videos</a>, working with the subject-matter experts and providing content assistance, video editing, and computer graphics as needed.</p>
				<p>Another project I took on was the creation of the 150-page downloadable <a href="discussionguides.htm">discussion guide</a> that accompanies the annual Global Leadership Summit Team Edition DVD. When I first worked on the guide in 2008, I was only responsible for writing the outline and process questions for each session, but throughout the project I observed many improvements that could be made in the process. I wrote a proposal to revise the process and in 2009 was able to implement it, first on a smaller scale with a different team edition project, and then for the 2009 Global Leadership Summit Team Edition. My colleague wrote the content, which I helped edit. Then, having taught myself how to use Adobe InDesign and Photoshop, I did the design work by adapting an existing template. Because I knew the content intimately, and my colleagues and I had a shared vision for how the tool would be used, the design and routing process was able to proceed much more smoothly than in the past. (After I left the WCA staff, I created the 2010 guide as a independent contractor, doing all the writing and design work myself.)</p>
				<p>During my time at the WCA, I also was involved in several Web initiatives, including project-managing a Web site to enhance the in-person conference experience. My team and I worked with a designer to map out the flow of the site and created pages for each session. During the event, we updated the pages with related links, resources, blog posts, and process questions. I also developed the content for two eight-week <a href="elearningcourses.com">e-learning courses</a>, including two live webcasts per course, and produced 15+ webinars using the <a href="http://gotowebinar.com">GoToWebinar</a> platform.</p>
				<p>Through working on these projects, I began to realize how important visual and textual clarity are to me, and I decided to seek further education to increase my communication and design skills. So, in August 2010, I left the WCA to begin full-time pursuit of my <a href="http://www.iit.edu/csl/hum/programs/grad/tcid.shtml">master's in technical communication and information design</a> at <a href="http://iit.edu/">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>. Through my <a href="coursework.htm">studies</a>, I hope to continue learning how best to organize information on a page and bring visual clarity to a message, so that at a glance a reader has a grasp of what the content entails. I am also interested in learning the communication principles involved in creating informative documents that people actually want to read. </p>
