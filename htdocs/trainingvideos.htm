			<h2>Training Videos</h2>

				<p>During my time at Willow Creek Association, I worked on a three-person team to pilot a series of short-form online training videos. In 2008, we created 58 videos on the topics of technical arts, spiritual formation, and children's ministry. I worked with subject-matter experts on their presentation content, edited the videos in Final Cut Pro, and created the CGs using Photoshop.</p>
