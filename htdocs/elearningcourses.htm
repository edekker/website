			<h2>E-Learning Courses</h2>

				<p>In 2010, my experience working on a diverse range of training resources proved vital as I was asked to put together the content for two eight-week e-learning courses. In addition to working with nine subject matter experts to develop new video-based content and live webcasts, I pulled from the WCA's extensive archive of conference sessions, webinar recordings, short-form training videos, and audio interviews. I also worked with my supervisor to write several self-assessments and individual assignments. In total, the two courses incorporated 67 unique content items.</p>
