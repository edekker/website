			<h2>IIT Coursework</h2>

				<p>In August 2010, I began to pursue my <a href="http://www.iit.edu/csl/hum/programs/grad/tcid.shtml">master's in technical communication and information design</a> at <a href="http://iit.edu/">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>. This fall, I am taking three courses:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Publication Management</li>
						<li>Standards-Based Web Design</li>
						<li>Usability Testing and Evaluation</li>
					</ul>

				<p>This website is the major project of Standards-Based Web Design. It is hand-coded, created without any WYSIWYG tools (e.g. Dreamweaver), and is standards-compliant.</p>

				<p>As my coursework continues and I have more artifacts to share, I will post them here.</p>
