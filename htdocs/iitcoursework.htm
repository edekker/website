			<h2>IIT Coursework</h2>

				<p>In August 2010, I began to pursue my <a href="http://www.iit.edu/csl/hum/programs/grad/tcid.shtml">master's in technical communication and information design</a> at <a href="http://iit.edu/">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>. I anticipate completing my degree in May 2012.</p>

				<p>Please note that this page is under construction as I continue to add project samples.</p>
				
				<h3>Publication Management</h3>
				
					<p><em>Course description:</em> Intensive work developing and using systems to create and deliver content digitally and in print. Special emphasis on project management and large-team collaboration.</p>
					
					<p>This course emphasized systems for content reuse and single-sourcing. Most of our coursework was done using the open source content management platform <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. My first attempt at using Drupal involved creating a site to archive my eBay listings (see <a href="/media/img/dekker_firstdrupalsite.jpg">screenshot</a>). It was a steep learning curve, but I was able to use views and metadata to generate a listing archive. The main project of the course was to create a Drupal site for a client. This <a href="/media/pdf/dekker_drupalmemo.pdf">memo</a> describes my contribution to my team's work on <a href="http://goldenlegsrunning.com">goldenlegsrunning.com</a>.
				
				<h3>Standards-Based Web Design</h3>
				
					<p><em>Course description:</em> Theory and practice of structuring and designing information for web-enabled devices. This course emphasizes web standards, accessibility, and agile design methods.</p>
					
					<p>In this course, I created the original version of this website. It is hand-coded, created without any WYSIWYG tools (e.g. Dreamweaver), and is standards-compliant. I continue to make edits and design changes to the site, but this <a href="/media/img/dekker_originalsitedesign.jpg">screenshot</a> shows the design as of the completion of the course.</p>
				
				<h3>Usability Testing and Evaluation</h3>
				
					<p><em>Course description:</em> An introduction to principles of user-centered design and to methods for conducting user experience research. Students will learn how to plan and conduct projects that evaluate the design, delivery, interface, and experience of a product or service. Course work includes designing studies, collecting and interpreting data, and reporting findings and recommendations from the perspective of user-centered design.</p>
				
					<p>In this course, we used a wide range of usability testing techniques to assess websites and other interfaces. I worked with a group in a semester-long project to analyze the usability of the Chicago parking kiosks. This <a href="/media/pdf/dekker_usabilityreport.pdf">report</a> presents our findings and recommendations for improvement. I was responsible for conducting the heuristic evaluation (page 14-19) and cognitive walkthrough (page 19-23).
				
				<h3>Document Design</h3>
				
					<p><em>Course description:</em> Principles and strategies for effective document and information design, focusing on print media and familiarizing students with current research and theory as well as with practices in document design. Students design, produce, and evaluate documents for a variety of applications, such as instructional materials, brochures, newsletters, graphics, and tables.</p>
				
					<p>In this course, we used Microsoft Word and Adobe InDesign to create families of documents, adhering to Robin Williams' design principles of proximity, alignment, repetition, and contrast. I designed this trifold <a href="/media/pdf/dekker_brochure.pdf">brochure</a> with an accompanying <a href="/media/pdf/dekker_mailer.pdf">letter and forms</a>.
				
				<h3>Knowledge Management</h3>
				
					<p><em>Course description:</em> Analysis of the nature and uses of systems and knowledge in business and professional settings, focusing on the technical communicator's roles and tasks in generating and transferring data, information and knowledge within organizations.</p>
				
				<h3>Linguistics and Technical Communication</h3>
				
					<p><em>Course description:</em> This course examines how core concepts in linguistic theory are applied to issues in technical communication. Topics include discourse-level phenomena, sentence structure, sound patterns of speech, and language processing. The goal of the course is for students to be prepared to make their own contributions to tech comm using linguistic theory as a research framework.</p>
				
				<h3>Communicating Science</h3>

					<p><em>Course description:</em> Principles and strategies for communicating scientific information in professional settings. Students develop a literature review, proposal, and feasibility study; learn how to adapt scientific information to various audiences; and complete exercises on style, grammar, and other elements of effective professional communication. Emphasis on usability, cohesion, and style in each assignment.</p>
